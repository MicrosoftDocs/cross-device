### MSA and AAD Authentication Registration

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Active Directory (AAD) accounts are not supported with the Device Relay APIs.

If you do not already have an MSA and wish to use one, register on [account.microsoft.com](https://account.microsoft.com/account).

Next, if you are using MSA as the authentication and identity framework for your users, you must register your app with Microsoft by following the instructions on the [Application Registration Portal](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/) (if you do not have a Microsoft developer account, you must create one first). You should receive a client ID string for your app; make sure to remember the location or save this. Later this will be used during Graph Notifications onboarding. 
Note that an app using MSA authentication needs to be registered as a Live SDK application.

If you're writing an app that uses AAD as work account or school account authentication and identity framework, you must register your app via [Azure Active Directory Authentication Libraries](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-authentication-libraries) in order to get the client ID.

When creating a new app registration, there are a few permissions required in order to use Graph Notifications and other connected device platform capabilities. Please see below.

* Add Graph Notifications permission under Activity Feed Service APIs.
