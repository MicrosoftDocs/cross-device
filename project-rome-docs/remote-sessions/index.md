# Remote Sessions

The remote sessions feature allows an app to connect to other devices through a session.

Remote sessions can be used for explicit app-to-app messaging or for brokered exchange of system-managed data.

Sessions can be created by any device on a supported platform, and other devices, including devices signed in by other users, can request to join.
