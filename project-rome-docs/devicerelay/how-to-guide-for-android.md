# Implementing device relay for Android

The Device Relay functionality of Project Rome consists of a set of APIs that support two main features: remote launching (also known as commanding) and app services.

Remote Launching APIs support scenarios where a process on a remote device is started from a local device. For example, a user might be listening to the radio on their phone in the car, but when they get home they use their phone to transfer playback to their Xbox which is hooked up to the home stereo.

App Services APIs allow an application to establish a persistent pipeline between two devices through which messages containing any arbitrary content can be sent. For example, a photo sharing app running on a mobile device could establish a connection with the user's PC in order to retrieve photos.

The features of Project Rome are supported by an underlying platform called the Connected Devices Platform. This guide provides the necessary steps to get started using the Connected Devices Platform, and then explains how to use the platform to implement Device Relay related features.

This steps below will reference code from the [Project Rome Android sample app](https://github.com/Microsoft/project-rome/tree/master/Android/samples).

## Using the platform

[!INCLUDE [android/create-setup-events-start-platform](../includes/android/create-setup-events-start-platform.md)]

### Discover remote devices and apps

A **RemoteSystemWatcher** instance will handle the core functionality of this section. Declare it in the class which is to discover remote systems.

```Java
private RemoteSystemWatcher mWatcher = null;
```

Before you create a watcher and start discovering devices, you may wish to add discovery filters to determine which kinds of devices your app will target. These can be determined by user input or hard-coded into the app, depending on your use case.

```Java
private void onStartWatcherClicked() {
    // RemoteSystemWatcher cannot be started unless the platform is 
    // initialized and the user is logged in. It may be helpful to use
    // methods like these to track the state of the application.
    // See the sample app for their implementations.
    if (!getMainActivity().isSignedIn()) {
        return;
    }
    if (!getMainActivity().isPlatformInitialized()) {
        return;
    }

    // create and populate a list of filters. The filter choices below are arbitrary.
    ArrayList<RemoteSystemFilter> filters = new ArrayList<>();

    /*  RemoteSystemDiscoveryType filters can be used to filter the types of Remote Systems you discover.
    Possible values:
        ANY(0),
        PROXIMAL(1),
        CLOUD(2),
        SPATIALLY_PROXIMAL(3)
    */
    filters.add(new RemoteSystemDiscoveryTypeFilter(RemoteSystemDiscoveryType.ANY));

    /*  RemoteSystemStatusType filters can be used to filter the status of Remote Systems you discover.
    Possible values:
        ANY(0),
        AVAILABLE(1)
    */
    filters.add(new RemoteSystemStatusTypeFilter(RemoteSystemStatusType.AVAILABLE));


    /*  RemoteSystemKindFilter can filter the types of devices you want to discover.
    Possible values are members of the RemoteSystemKinds class.
    */
    String[] kinds = new String[] { RemoteSystemKinds.Phone(), RemoteSystemKinds.Tablet() };

    RemoteSystemKindFilter kindFilter = new RemoteSystemKindFilter(kinds);
    filters.add(kindFilter);

    /*  RemoteSystemAuthorizationKind determines the category of user whose system(s) you want to discover.
    Possible values:
        SAME_USER(0),
        ANONYMOUS(1)
    */
    filters.add(new RemoteSystemAuthorizationKindFilter(RemoteSystemAuthorizationKind.SAME_USER)); 
    // ...
```

At this point, the app can initialize the watcher object which determine how your app will parse and interact with devices that are discovered.

```Java
    // ...

    // Create a RemoteSystemWatcher
    mWatcher = new RemoteSystemWatcher(filters.toArray(new RemoteSystemFilter[filters.size()]));
    }

    // ...
```

It is recommended that your app maintain a set of discovered devices (represented by **RemoteSystem** instances) and display information about available devices and their apps (such as display name and device type) on the UI. 

The following class stubs can be used as event listeners for the watcher instance.

```Java
private class RemoteSystemAddedListener implements EventListener<RemoteSystemWatcher, RemoteSystem> {
    @Override
    public void onEvent(RemoteSystemWatcher remoteSystemWatcher, RemoteSystem remoteSystem) {
        // add instance "remoteSystem" to program memory. See sample for full implementation.
    }
}

private class RemoteSystemUpdatedListener implements EventListener<RemoteSystemWatcher, RemoteSystem> {
    @Override
    public void onEvent(RemoteSystemWatcher remoteSystemWatcher, RemoteSystem remoteSystem) {
        // update instance "remoteSystem" in program memory. See sample for full implementation.
    }
}

private class RemoteSystemRemovedListener implements EventListener<RemoteSystemWatcher, RemoteSystem> {
    @Override
    public void onEvent(RemoteSystemWatcher remoteSystemWatcher, RemoteSystem remoteSystem) {
        // remove instance "remoteSystem" from program memory. See sample for full implementation.
    }
}

private class RemoteSystemWatcherErrorOccurredListener implements EventListener<RemoteSystemWatcher, RemoteSystemWatcherError> {
    @Override
    public void onEvent(RemoteSystemWatcher remoteSystemWatcher, RemoteSystemWatcherError remoteSystemWatcherError) {
        // handle the error
    }
}
```

Once `mWatcher.start` is called, it will begin watching for remote system activity and will raise events when devices are discovered, updated, or removed from the set of discovered devices. It will scan continuously in the background, so it is recommended that you stop the watcher when you no longer need it to avoid unnecessary network communication and battery drain.

```Java
// if you call this from the activity's onPause method, you ensure that
// it will stop when the activity exits the foreground.
public void stopWatcher() {
    if (mWatcher == null) {
        return;
    }
    mWatcher.stop();
}
```
## Example use case: implementing remote launching and remote app services

At this point in your code, you should have a working list of **RemoteSystem** objects that refer to available devices. What you do with these devices will depend on the function of your app. The main types of interaction are remote launching and remote app services. They are explained in the following sections.

### A) Remote launching

The following code shows how to select one of these devices (ideally this is done through a UI control) and then use **RemoteLauncher** to launch an app on it by passing an app-compatible URI. 

It's important to note that a remote launch can target a remote device (in which case the host device will launch the given URI with its default app for that URI scheme) _or_ a specific remote application on that device. 

As the previous section demonstrated, discovery happens at the device level first (a **RemoteSystem** represents a device), but you can call the `getApplications` method on a **RemoteSystem** instance to get an array of **RemoteSystemApp** objects, which represent apps on the remote device that have been registered to use the Connected Devices Platform (just as you registered your own app in the preliminary steps above). Both **RemoteSystem** and **RemoteSystemApp** can be used to construct a **RemoteSystemConnectionRequest**, which is what is needed to launch a URI.

```java
// this could be a RemoteSystemApp instead. Either way, it 
// must be defined somewhere in the application before the launch operation
// is called.
private RemoteSystem target; 

// ...

/**
* Responsible for calling into the Rome API to launch the given URI and provides
* the logic to handle the RemoteLaunchUriStatus response.
* @param uri URI to launch
* @param target The target for the launch URI request
*/
private void launchUri(final String uri, final RemoteSystem target, final long messageId)
{
    RemoteLauncher remoteLauncher = new RemoteLauncher();

    AsyncOperation<RemoteLaunchUriStatus> resultOperation = remoteLauncher.launchUriAsync(new RemoteSystemConnectionRequest(target), uri);
    // ...
```
Use the returned **AsyncOperation** to handle the result of the launch attempt.

```Java
    // ...
    resultOperation.whenCompleteAsync(new AsyncOperation.ResultBiConsumer<RemoteLaunchUriStatus, Throwable>() {
        @Override
        public void accept(RemoteLaunchUriStatus status, Throwable throwable) throws Throwable {
            if (throwable != null) {
                // handle the exception, referencing "throwable"
            } else {
                if (status == RemoteLaunchUriStatus.SUCCESS) {
                    // report the success case
                } else {
                    // report the non-success case, referencing "status"
                }
            }
        }
    });
}
```
Depending on the URI that is sent, you can launch an app in a specific state or configuration on a remote device. This allows for the ability to continue a user task, like watching a movie, on a different device without interruption. 

Depending on your use case, you may need to cover the cases in which no apps on the targeted system can handle the URI, or multiple apps can handle it. The **[RemoteLauncher](https://docs.microsoft.com/java/api/com.microsoft.connecteddevices.commanding._remote_launcher)** class and **[RemoteLauncherOptions](https://docs.microsoft.com/java/api/com.microsoft.connecteddevices.commanding._remote_launcher_options)** class describe how to do this.

### B) Remote app services

Your Android app can use the Connected Devices Portal interact with app services on other devices. This provides many ways to communicate with other devices&mdash;all without needing to bring an app to the foreground of the host device. 

#### Set up the app service on the target device
This guide will use the [Roman Test App for Windows](http://aka.ms/romeapp) as its target app service. Therefore, the code below will cause an Android app to look for that specific app service on the given remote system. If you wish to test this scenario,download the Roman Test App on a Windows device and make sure you are signed in with the same MSA that you used in the preliminary steps above. 

For instructions on how to write your own UWP app service, see [Create and consume an app service (UWP)](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/launch-resume/how-to-create-and-consume-an-app-service). You will need to make a few changes in order to make the service compatible with Connected Devices. See the [UWP guide for remote app services](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/launch-resume/communicate-with-a-remote-app-service) for instructions on how to do this. 

#### Open an app service connection on the client device
Your Android app must acquire a reference to a remote device or application. Like the launch section, this scenario requires the use of a **RemoteSystemConnectionRequest**, which can be constructed from either a **RemoteSystem** or a **RemoteSystemApp** representing an available app on the system.


```Java
// this could be a RemoteSystemApp instead. Either way, it 
// must be defined somewhere in the application before the app service
// connection is opened.
private RemoteSystem target = null;
```
Additionally, your app will need to identify its targeted app service using two strings: the *app service name* and *package identifier*. These are found in the source code of the app service provider (see [Create and consume an app service (UWP)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/launch-resume/how-to-create-and-consume-an-app-service) for details on how to get this strings for Windows app services). Together these strings construct the **AppServiceDescription**, which is fed into an **AppServiceConnection** instance.

```Java
// this is defined below
private AppServiceConnection connection = null; 


/**
* Creates an AppService connection with the current identifier and service name and opens the
* app service connection.
*/
private void onNewConnectionButtonClicked()
{
    connection = new AppServiceConnection();

    // these hard-coded strings must be defined elsewhere in the app
    connection.setAppServiceDescription(new AppServiceDescription(mAppServiceName, mPackageIdentifier));

    // this method is defined below
    openAppServiceConnection();
}
```
```Java
/**
* Establish an app service connection.
* Opens the given AppService connection using the connection request. Once the connection is
* opened, it adds the listeners for request-received and close. Catches all exceptions
* to show behavior of API surface exceptions.
*/
private void openAppServiceConnection()
{
    // optionally report outbound request
    // ...

    RemoteSystemConnectionRequest connectionRequest = new RemoteSystemConnectionRequest(target));

    /* Will asynchronously open the app service connection using the given connection request
    * When this is done, we log the traffic in the UI for visibility to the user (for sample purposes)
    * We can check the status of the connection to determine whether or not it was successful, and show 
    * some UI if it wasn't (in this case it is part of the list item).
    */
    connection.openRemoteAsync(connectionRequest)
        .thenAcceptAsync(new AsyncOperation.ResultConsumer<AppServiceConnectionStatus>() {
            @Override
            public void accept(AppServiceConnectionStatus appServiceConnectionStatus) throws Throwable {
                // optionally report inbound response
                // ...

                if (appServiceConnectionStatus != AppServiceConnectionStatus.SUCCESS) {
                    // report the error, referencing "appServiceConnectionStatus"
                    return;
                }
            }
        })
        .exceptionally(new AsyncOperation.ResultFunction<Throwable, Void>() {
            @Override
            public Void apply(Throwable throwable) throws Throwable {
                // report the exception
                return null;
            }
        });
}
```

#### Create a message to send to the app service

Declare a variable to store the message to send. On Android, the messages that you send to remote app services will be of the **Map** type.

```Java
private Map<String, Object> mMessagePayload = null;
```
> [!NOTE]
> When your app communicates with app services on other platforms, the Connected Devices Platform translates the **Map** into the matching construct on the receiving platform. For example, a **[Map](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/Map)** sent from this app to a Windows app service gets translated into a [**ValueSet**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.foundation.collections.valueset) object (of the .NET Framework), which can then be interpreted by the app service. Information passed in the other direction undergoes the reverse translation.

The following method composes a message that can be interpreted by the Roman Test App's app service for Windows.

```Java
/**
* Send the current message payload through all selected AppService connections on a non-UI
* thread as to not block user interaction, a result of the delay between API calls.
*/
private void onMessageButtonClicked()
{
    mMessagePayload = new HashMap<>();
    // Add the required fields of RomanApp on Windows
    DateFormat df = new SimpleDateFormat(DATE_FORMAT);
    mMessagePayload.put("Type", "ping");
    mMessagePayload.put("CreationDate", df.format(new Date()));
    mMessagePayload.put("TargetId", "check if this field needs to be included");

    // this method is defined below.
    sendMessage(connection, mMessagePayload);
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **Map**s that are passed between apps and services in the remote app services scenario must adhere to the following format: Keys must be Strings, and the values may be: Strings, boxed numeric types (integers or floating points), boxed booleans, android.graphics.Point, android.graphics.Rect, java.util.Date, java.util.UUID, homogeneous arrays of any of these types, or other **Map** objects that meet this specification.

#### Send message to the app service

Once the app service connection is established and the message is created, sending it to the app service is simple and can be done from anywhere in the app that has a reference to the app service connection instance and the message.


```java

// When assigning message IDs, use an incremental counter
private AtomicInteger mMessageIdAppServices = new AtomicInteger(0);

// ...

/**
* Send a message using the app service connection
* Send the given Map object through the given AppServiceConnection. Uses an internal messageId
* for logging purposes.
* @param connection AppServiceConnection to send the Map payload
* @param message Payload to be translated to a ValueSet
*/
private void sendMessage(final AppServiceConnection connection, Map<String, Object> message)
{
    final long messageId = mMessageIdAppServices.incrementAndGet();

    connection.sendMessageAsync(message)
        .thenAcceptAsync(new AsyncOperation.ResultConsumer<AppServiceResponse>() {
            @Override
            public void accept(AppServiceResponse appServiceResponse) throws Throwable {
                // optionally report an inbound response

                // this method is defined below
                handleAppServiceResponse(appServiceResponse, messageId);
            }
        })
        .exceptionally(new AsyncOperation.ResultFunction<Throwable, Void>() {
            @Override
            public Void apply(Throwable throwable) throws Throwable {
                // report the exception, referencing "throwable"

                return null;
            }
        });

    // optionally log the outbound message request here, referencing 
    // connection.getAppServiceDescription().getName() as the recipient.
}
```

The app service's response will be received and interpreted by the following method.

```Java
private void handleAppServiceResponse(AppServiceResponse appServiceResponse, long messageId)
{
    AppServiceResponseStatus status = appServiceResponse.getStatus();
    if (status == AppServiceResponseStatus.SUCCESS)
    {
        // the message was delivered successfully; interpret the response.
        Map<String, Object> response;
        response = appServiceResponse.getMessage();

        // in the Roman App case, the response contains the date it was created.
        String dateStr = (String)response.get("CreationDate");
        DateFormat df = new SimpleDateFormat(DATE_FORMAT, Locale.getDefault());

        // in this very simple use case, we compare the dates to get the total
        // transit time of the message response.
        try {
            Date startDate = df.parse(dateStr);
            Date nowDate = new Date();
            long diff = nowDate.getTime() - startDate.getTime();
            // do something with "diff"
        } catch (ParseException e) { e.printStackTrace(); }
    }
}
```
In the Roman App case, the response contains the date it was created, so in this very simple use case, we can compare the dates to get the total transit time of the message response.

This concludes a single message exchange with a remote app service.

#### Finish app service communication

When your app is finished interacting with the target device's app service, close the connection between the two devices.

```java
// Close the given AppService connection
private void closeAppServiceConnection()
{
    connection.close();
}
```
