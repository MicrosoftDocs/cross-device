### Configure your app to be APNs notification-compatible

After you complete the workflow on the Developer dashboard, you must modify the actual code of your app to make capable of receiving push notifications. First, make sure to add the "remote-notifications" **UIBackgroundMode** to your app's _Info.plist_ to allow the app to receive notifications while running in the background. 

Second, when your app starts up, you must request authorization to display alert notifications. This is done by calling either `-[UIApplication registerUsernotificationSettings:categories:]` or `-[UNUserNotificationCenter requestAuthorizationWithOptions:completionHandler:]`, depending on what version of iOS you're targeting. Once your app has acquired the authorization, you can then register to receive remote notifications by calling `-[UIApplication registerForRemoteNotifications]`. 

### Associate the Connected Devices Platform with APNs native push notification for iOS. 
Like previously mentioned, the app clients need to provide knowledge about the native push notification pipeline being used for each mobile platform to the client-side SDK and the Connected Devices Platform during the registration process, to allow Graph notification service to fan-out notifications to each app client endpoint when your app server publishes a user-targeting notification via MS Graph APIs.
In the steps above, you initialized the Platform without defining the *notificationProvider* parameter. Here, you need to construct and pass in an object that implements **[MCDNotificationProvider](../../objectivec-api/core/MCDNotificationProvider.md)**. The main thing to note is the `getNotificationRegistrationAsync:` method, which must return a **[MCDNotificationRegistration](../../objectivec-api/core/MCDNotificationRegistration.md)** instance. The **MCDNotificationRegistration** is responsible for supplying the Connected Devices Platform with an access token (and related information) for the notification service.

Deliver this registration in your implementation of **MCDNotificationProvider**. Then, the Platform initialization call should provide the local Platform with access to the push notification service, allowing your app to receive data from the server-side Connected Devices Platform, which relays launch requests and app service messages from other devices. 

The following is an implementation of **MCDNotificationProvider** from the sample app.

```ObjectiveC
@implementation NotificationProvider
{
    MCDRegistrationUpdatedEvent* _registrationUpdated;
    MCDNotificationRegistration* _notificationRegistration;
}

+ (instancetype)sharedInstance
{
    static NotificationProvider* sharedInstance = nil;

    static dispatch_once_t onceToken;
    dispatch_once(&onceToken, ^{ sharedInstance = [[NotificationProvider alloc] init]; });

    return sharedInstance;
}

+ (void)updateNotificationRegistration:(MCDNotificationRegistration*)notificationRegistration
{
    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0),
        ^{ [[NotificationProvider sharedInstance] _updateNotificationRegistration:notificationRegistration]; });
}

// MCDNotificationProvider
@synthesize registrationUpdated = _registrationUpdated;

- (void)getNotificationRegistrationAsync:(nonnull void (^)(MCDNotificationRegistration* _Nullable, NSError* _Nullable))completionBlock
{
    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0), ^{ completionBlock(_notificationRegistration, nil); });
}

- (instancetype)init
{
    if (self = [super init])
    {
        _registrationUpdated = [MCDRegistrationUpdatedEvent new];
    }

    return self;
}

- (void)_updateNotificationRegistration:(MCDNotificationRegistration*)notificationRegistration
{
    _notificationRegistration = notificationRegistration;

    [_registrationUpdated raiseWithNotificationRegistration:notificationRegistration];
}
@end
```

The following sample code updates this **MCDNotificationProvider** with a filled-in **MCDNotificationRegistration**.

```ObjectiveC
/*
* NotificationRegistration is constructed with four parameters:
* Type: This is GCM or FCM or APN (the notification platform type).
* Token: This is the NSData that APNs sends to your app delegate's didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken: method. You must convert the NSData into a string by hex-encoding it.
* SenderId: This is your appâ€™s bundle identifier. 
* DisplayName: This should be the name of the app that you used when you registered it on the Microsoft dev portal. 
*/
[NotificationProvider
    updateNotificationRegistration:[[MCDNotificationRegistration alloc]
        initWithNotificationType:MCDNotificationTypeAPN
        token:deviceTokenStr
        appId:[[NSBundle mainBundle] bundleIdentifier]
        appDisplayName:(NSString*)[[NSBundle mainBundle]
            objectForInfoDictionaryKey:@"CFBundleDisplayName"]]];
```
