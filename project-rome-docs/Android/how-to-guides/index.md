# Project Rome for Android how-to guides (preview release)

Here you will find how-to guides for developers who wish to implement Project Rome features in their Android apps. You will need an Android app development IDE and an Android device or emulator (Android 4.4.2 or later) to use these features.

* First, see the [Getting started](getting-started-rome-android.md) guide for all the preliminary steps needed to set up the Rome SDK for Android.
* Then, see the [Commanding guide](command-remote-devices-and-apps-android.md), [Hosting guide](hosting-android.md), or [Activities guide](user-activities-android.md), depending on which scenarios you are targeting.
* You can view the API reference documentation in the [api reference](../api-reference/index.md) section.
* Take a look at the [Android sample app](tbdGH) to see a working example of Project Rome features.
